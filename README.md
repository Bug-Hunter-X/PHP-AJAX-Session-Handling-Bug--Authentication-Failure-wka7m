This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in PHP's session handling, specifically within the context of AJAX requests.  The bug is caused by a missing or incorrect session ID propagation mechanism between the main page and an AJAX request.  The `check_login.php` file shows the buggy code, while `check_login_solution.php` shows the corrected version.

The problem occurs because `session_start()` is called in the AJAX handler without ensuring the session ID is properly passed from the initial page load. This can result in creating a new session, breaking user authentication.

The solution focuses on making sure the AJAX request carries the necessary session cookie (usually done by default by the browser, but might need explicit handling in certain configurations).

This example highlights the importance of verifying session consistency in applications using AJAX, and provides a practical illustration of debugging and resolving this kind of session management issue.
